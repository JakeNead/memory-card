# Memory Game

This project aimed to use React hooks to manage state data that I fetched from an external API. The first version used promise.all() to fetch 12 random images. Although fun to finally use the all() method, I quickly ran into my demo account request limit and had to get all the images from a single request. 

The game mechanics are straightforward, the styling is minimalistic, it's responsive on all devices, and it's a fun challenge!
